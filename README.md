# Numerical-Methods---Cooling-Aluminum-Cylinder-
## What is this? 
Matlab code for heat transfer experimental to illustrate use of numerical methods for solving various heat transfer components of a solid cylinder immersed in an ice bath. 

## What is calculated? 
* Find convective cooling coefficient h 
* Plot of temperature vs. time data 
* 2nd order polynomial regression model of thermal expansion coefficient 
* Approximate change in diameter of aluminum cylinder in ice water for several hours 
* Estimated rate of change of stored heat in cylinder for a specified point
